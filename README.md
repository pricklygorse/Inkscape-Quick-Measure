# Inkscape Quick Measure Extension

A super simple extension to simply output the length of a selected path or paths (straight or beziers), including the individual segment lengths and cumulative lengths.

Has been tested most on Inkscape 1.2 and 1.3. *Should* work on 1.1, but I recommend updating. Inkscape has improved so much.


## Installation

Add the .inx and .py files to your Inkscape user extensions folder. You can find this by opening Inkscape Preferences (Edit-Preferences) and selecting the System tab. Restart Inkscape and the extension will appear under Extensions - Prickly Gorse - Quick Measure.

I plan to release more related extensions soon, which will all be placed under the Prickly Gorse heading.

## Usage

Select your path (or multiple individual paths) and run the extension.

Shapes need to be converted to paths (Object - Object to Path).

I wrote this to assist with making sewing patterns for bike and backpacking bags. Bit of a shameless plug, but if you are interested in sewing your own outdoor gear without making your own patterns, check out [www.payhip.com/pricklygorse](http://www.payhip.com/pricklygorse) for my sewing guides (some free ones :D ), or [www.pricklygorsegear.com/tutorials-myog](http://www.pricklygorsegear.com/tutorials-myog) for my main website.

# Acknowledgements

The code is built from the quite a bit more complicated Measure Path extension that comes pre-installed with Inkscape. Huge thanks to the authors of those extensions, and everyone who has contributed to the Inkscape project as a whole. Support open source!
